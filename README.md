for this lab, we were tasked with making a moveable sprite based on arrow key inputs, which would change color when touching another sprite. I made a blue circle move with the arrow keys, and when it touches the small yellow cirlce, it changes colors to red and the yellow circle disapears. i did this by using a collision detection by checking the distance the two sprites were away from each other with the "dist" keyword.
